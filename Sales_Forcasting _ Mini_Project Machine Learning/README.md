# Sales Forecasting

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to forecast sales for a given dataset. The goal is to predict future sales based on historical data, helping businesses to plan and manage their inventory and resources more effectively.

## Problem Statement
Given a set of historical sales data, we aim to predict future sales for a specific time period. The dataset includes various features such as sales, date, and product information, which will be used to train the forecasting model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes:
- **Sales Data**: A historical record of sales transactions.
- **Features**: Date, Product ID, Quantity Sold, etc.
- **Target Variable**: Sales value to predict.
